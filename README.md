# VBA_Stock_Analysis
## Overview 
Our friend Steve is passionate about Finance and the stock market. He is managing his parents’ investments into DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ) but wants to do a little more research with how other stocks perform over 2017 and 2018. 
I’ve refactored the VBA code to help illuminate this comparison.

## Results
DQ had the biggest decline of the 12 stocks in this dataset, a -62.6% return. The two stocks that had a positive return were ENPH and RUN, both over 81% return. Based on this information, Steve’s parents should re-allocate their investments into the more long-term promising stocks of ENPH and RUN.

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
1.	Adv - At times, you can find the original code hard to read/follow along so refactoring allows you to clean it up nicely.
2.	Disadv – When you refactor VBA code, you may have to add to the code itself, making it longer to run.
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
1.	By having comments layered within the code, it helps a second person pick up the code to refactor.
